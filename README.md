INTRODUCTION:

The given Java program generates a random password of a specified length and constructs an email address by combining the provided user ID with the generated password. It uses predefined character sets for numbers, letters (both uppercase and lowercase), and symbols to create a diverse pool of characters for the password. The program prompts the user to enter an email ID and the desired password length, validates the input, generates the password, and constructs the email address. Finally, it displays the generated password and email address on the console.

THE TOPICS COVERED IN THE GIVEN JAVA PROGRAM INCLUDE:

1. Random password generation: The program demonstrates how to generate a random password by selecting characters from predefined character sets using a random index.

2. String manipulation: The program uses string concatenation and string appending to construct the email address by combining the user ID with the generated password.

3. User input validation: The program validates user input to ensure that the user ID is not empty and the password length is a positive value.

4. SecureRandom class: The program utilizes the SecureRandom class from the Java security package to generate random numbers for selecting characters in the password generation process.

5. Console input/output: The program prompts the user for input, reads the input from the console using a Scanner object, and displays the generated password and email address as output.

6. StringBuilder class: The program uses the StringBuilder class to efficiently build the password character by character, improving performance compared to concatenating strings directly.

7. Constants: The program utilizes constants to define the character sets for numbers, letters, and symbols, making it easy to modify or expand the character pool for password generation.

8. Control flow: The program includes if-else statements to validate user input and conditionally display error messages or proceed with password and email generation.

9. Method abstraction: The program encapsulates the password and email generation logic in separate methods, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

These topics collectively contribute to the functionality of the program, which generates a random password and constructs an email address based on user input.
